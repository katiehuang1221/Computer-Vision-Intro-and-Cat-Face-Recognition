# Metis Investigation
This is the repo for my metis investigation on computer vision. The blog can be read [here](https://katiehuang1221.medium.com/an-introduction-to-computer-vision-131826e2b512).
Besides the slide deck, there are also three python scripts for OpenCV demo (cat face detection, cat face recognition training and testing). The Jupyter notebook about training YOLOv3 for cat eye detection is from The AI Guy's great [tutorial](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/YOLOv3-Cloud-Tutorial).
